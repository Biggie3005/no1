      <p>It seems as if the rain has been falling without respite for six weeks, and the impact has been devastating.
    So far more than 120 people have lost their lives, including at least 50 in a deluge on Monday in an area about 60km (37 miles) from Nairobi.
This is the wet season, but there has been far more rainfall than what is normally expected, which has been put down to the El Ni√±o weather phenomenon.
Rivers and sewers have overflowed, roads have become waterways and homes have been destroyed.</p>
<br><br><br>

          <p>Flooding in Nairobi is not unusual but the sheer scale of this year's deluge has exposed longer term problems with the way the city has developed.
    "You can't contain nature. It doesn't work like that," Prof Alfred Omenya, an urban planning and environment expert, told the BBC.
    He says that much of the city sits on top the Nairobi River's floodplain, which cuts through the capital. A number of other rivers and streams also flow through Nairobi.

            <p>
    The scale of the flooding in Kenya is staggering, with reports indicating that thousands of people have been 
    affected. Homes have been submerged, crops destroyed, and livestock swept away, leaving many communities without
    basic necessities.The impact extends beyond residential areas, with crucial infrastructure such as roads and 
    bridges damaged hampering rescue efforts and hindering access to essential services.</p> <br>
